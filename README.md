# FHDO_LogiBox - Logic Gate Demonstrator
Project Overview
This open-source hardware project is a 10x10â€¯cm PCB designed to demonstrate the function of seven fundamental logic gates: OR, AND, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR, and NOT. The board uses three standard logic ICs (quad NAND, quad XOR, octal inverter) and lets users manually set two logic inputs (A and B) using physical switches. The output (Y) is shown via an LED, so you can instantly see the result for every gate type. Both input states (A and B) are likewise visualized with LEDs for clear feedback.

The demonstrator is ideal for educational settings, workshops, or personal study, enabling hands-on exploration of digital logic.
