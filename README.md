# FHDO_LogiBox - Logic Gate Demonstrator

## Project Overview

This open-source hardware project is a 10x10â€¯cm PCB designed to demonstrate the function of seven fundamental logic gates: OR, AND, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR, and NOT. The board uses three standard logic ICs (quad NAND, quad XOR, octal inverter) and lets users manually set two logic inputs (A and B) using physical switches. The output (Y) is shown via an LED, so you can instantly see the result for every gate type. Both input states (A and B) are likewise visualized with LEDs for clear feedback.

This demonstrator is well suited for classrooms, workshops, and self-guided learning, offering a practical way to investigate digital logic functions. It also serves as an accessible soldering project, with through-hole switches and ICs providing a straightforward assembly experience for beginners.
